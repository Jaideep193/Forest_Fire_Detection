# Forest_Fire_Detection
# ðŸŒ² Forest Fire Detection using Deep Learning ðŸ”¥

This repository contains a deep learning project that detects forest fires in images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and is designed to help with early wildfire detection systems.


## ðŸ§  Model Overview

The model is a CNN trained on a labeled dataset of forest images categorized as **Fire** or **No Fire**. The network learns spatial features in the images to make binary classification predictions.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forest-fire-detection.git
cd forest-fire-detection
