# Forest_Fire_Detection
# 🌲 Forest Fire Detection using Deep Learning 🔥

This repository contains a deep learning project that detects forest fires in images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and is designed to help with early wildfire detection systems.


## 🧠 Model Overview

The model is a CNN trained on a labeled dataset of forest images categorized as **Fire** or **No Fire**. The network learns spatial features in the images to make binary classification predictions.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forest-fire-detection.git
cd forest-fire-detection
Launch the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Forest_Fire_Detection_using_Deep_learning.ipynb
Run all cells to train the model and see predictions.

✅ Make sure the dataset is placed in the correct folders (train/ and test/) as expected by the notebook.
